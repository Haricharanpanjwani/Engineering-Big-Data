      Winnow update function, If the current model predicts the output correctly, donâ€™t change anything. 
      If it predicts true but should predict false, it is over-shooting, so weights that were used in the 
      prediction (i.e. the weights attached to active features) are reduced i.e., divide the weights of every 
      feature by alpha. Conversely, if the prediction is false but the correct result should be true, the active 
      features are not used enough to reach the threshold, so they should be bumped up i.e., multiply the weights 
      of every feature by alpha.
