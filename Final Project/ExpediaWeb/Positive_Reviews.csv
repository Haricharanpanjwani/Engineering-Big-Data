"The hotel was close to the airport and with a late night arrival it was perfect.  The staff throughout the hotel were very nice -- offering advice on routes to take for scenic landscapes, pleasant upon check in, warm goodbyes.  Having breakfast available on site is always a bonus.  We each found favorite choices and enjoyed the setting and the personable service.  The beds were very comfortable!  Everything was clean and neat.  We would stay here again with pleasure."
