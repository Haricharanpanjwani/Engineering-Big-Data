"Room wasn't cleaned for two days. The parking EXPENSIVE and EXTRA, per day.. plus if you wanted to pay half of the expensive fee you had to park and walk about 1/4 mile back to the hotel. Upcharge everything. No fridge in the room but they charge you to get one. Staff was rude. Didn't care that the room wasn't cleaned.. said they would send someone up to ""refresh"" the room, that was someone that knocked, handed me towels and left.. didn't even walk into the room."
Visited with parents from England. Needed to move from 1st room as pets had scratched the headboard badly and were unaware that this was a pet room. 2nd room bathroom floor clearly not cleaned. Well below standard expected of Sheraton. Should be below $100
"I stay in Madison 6+ times a year. From check-in to check-out, staff were the most unfriendly and unprofessional I have experienced. Dead bugs in the pool and hot tub, filthy entry ways that stunk of urine and smoke, hotel room was obviously not vacuumed as there was a pill on the floor near the desk, cereal on the side of the bed near the night stand; heater blew behind the drapes so room was cold. Furniture was old (1970's), scratched and falling apart. French toast for breakfast was hard as a rock, couldn't cut it with a knife. Don't expect luxury for $70 a night, but this was disgusting. Never again!"
"This is the worst hotel I've ever stayed in and I've stayed in plenty.  The room smelled terrible from mold and mildew and the carpet was actually damp from all of the humidity in the room.  The towels were damp, too, and the shower/bath tile had mold and mildew in the grout.  The air conditioner was minimally helpful in that it pulled SOME of the humidity out of the air, but I had to put the temperature to 60 degrees in order for it to run at all!  Even the bed and all of the bedding (pillows, sheets, bedspread) smelled absolutely awful, too.  I can't believe that this hotel room would've passed any kind of inspection.  It was horrible!  My advice?  Steer clear of this one.  It's VERY bad"
"I requested an accessible, non-smoking room with a queen size bed. When I arrived they tried to put me on the second floor in a building with no elevator. Why would you put an accessible room on the second floor? I requested to be moved to the first floor and the room I got was not accessible and I have problems in the bathtub. The room said non-smoking, but it smelled of smoke. There was no air conditioning in the public areas. I think that the owners were more concerned with saving a buck than servicing the customer."
"The  room, carpet and floor were very dirty. The non-smoking room smelled of cigarette smoke so badly that all my clothes smelled like cigarettes. The lights did not work properly. The towels were like sandpaper. Although they had internet, there was no computer or printer to use for boarding passes. My room key card had to be fixed twice so that I could get into my room.  And finally, they did not clean my room one day as the single staff person does not clean rooms after 10:30 am.  The property was littered with beer cans, alcohol bottles and cigarette butts. People loitered around the back of the hotel until 2 AM."
"The outside of the hotel should have been a clue to the inside. There were weeds all over the landscape.The door to the room was hard to open and close, there was mold on the ceiling in the shower, the fan was filthy, the strip in front of  the tub was loose in several places. There was no hairdryer or alarm clock. The air conditioner was really loud. The breakfast was cold cereal with really old bread."
"Sheets you could see through, stationed bottom mattress, smelled"
"I had to call room staff on retiring to bed. There was a metal spike sticking up through the mattress which I sat on.Only two junior members of staff on duty as it was ""staff night out"". I asked for a complaints form at the desk on checkout but was told there was no such thing. I asked for the Manager - no Manager either. The receptionist said she would contact the owners. I have had no joy but I do have the spike and photographs of it - kept as evidence!!B Smart"
Bathroom wasn't cleaned properly and Hotel facilities are poor conditions.
"The hotel was very old and beat down smelled like mold. The staff were very nice but not very well put together, I had to wait 15 mins for someone to check me in and out. Rooms looked very old and a moldy smell doors of the rooms were hard to open. I will not be staying at this hotel even again."
"Its an ok hotel. Why does this place have 4 stars? Extremely misleading!!. To us it felt like more of a motel. Beds were not comfortable, sheets weren't that clean. Room and bathroom was super small. Barely enough space to move around. No space in the bathroom to even change. Tiki bar and breakfast staff was not friendly. Only positve was that the location was close to everything."
Too loud. Not what I expected from la Quinta from prior experiences.
Dried urine spots all over the bathroom floor were a wonderful touch. Gives me great confidence on what's on the sheets.
Room was old and very smelly and this was supposed to be a non smoking.  Intolerable night.
Loud neighbors and lousy plumbing. Dark parking area. Overpriced.
Picked this hotel at last minute...pictures were misleading. Hotel is run down...smelled very musty. We walked in the room and within minutes we were getting bit by fleas!!!  Thank God we had not brought in our bags yet...that's just an awful feeling. Hotel switched our room but needless to say....didn't sleep well.
The room look so dirty  and the hotel lication is not good
"The room was hot the sliding door did not work and the elevators where too slow. Breakfast was not good,  it was cold and si not have bacon."
The rooms are beat. The reception staff are SO badly trained!
5 hours to check in. No iron or lotion available for the rooms.
"Not a great motel, other than hotel car show was fantastic"
Very old .needs updating.carpets dirty .hair on floors
This hotel is not reinvesting in maintenance and upkeep. Very uncomfortable bed. Everything made you feel dirty. I regret that it was too late to cancel our reservation
"The internet pics were very deceiving. This motel is very run down. The rooms had a strange odor, and the beds were extremly uncomfortable."
the hall ways smelled like urin kids screaming and yelling
"room was dirty, broken vanity, broken toilet. hotel had no pool. property was not the same as the picture given on internet."
I would not recommend this to friends. The manager was very rude and nasty
"Room had a musty smell and was very run down. Lock missing on door, and the bathroom was a disaster"
"Terrible neighborhood. Some meth heads nearby begging for money. If you stay here, leave the area asap when done"
